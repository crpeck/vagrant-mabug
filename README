Simple Vagrant that uses an Ubuntu 14.04 box and
-installs Tomcat running on port 8080 with Tomcat Manager in place
-installs Jenkins CI running on port 8090
--adds a job named 'hello-world'
--installs https://github.com/crpeck/hello-world.git to /usr/local/src
  and a post-commit hook to curl to jenkins to do a project run that
  builds teh hello-world.war file and auto-deploys it to Tomcat

To try this out:
point your browser at:
http://localhost:8090 for jenkins
http://localhost:8080/manager , userid=manager, password=12345 for Tomcat Manager

vagrant ssh
cd /usr/local/src/hello-world/src/main/webapp/
vi index.jsp
git add index.jsp
git commit -m 'updated index.jsp'

Then watch Jenkins build & autodeploy the new warfile
