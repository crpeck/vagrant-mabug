Simple Vagrant that uses an Ubuntu 14.04 box

typing "vagrant up" will:
-install Tomcat running on port 8080 with Tomcat Manager in place
-install Jenkins CI running on port 8090
--add a job named 'hello-world' to Jenkins
--install https://github.com/crpeck/hello-world.git to /usr/local/src
  and a post-commit hook to curl to jenkins to do a project run that
  builds the hello-world.war file and auto-deploys it to Tomcat

To try this out:
After you "vagrant up" point your browser at:

http://localhost:8090 for jenkins
-click on the "hello-world" project
-click on Build Now (on the left hand side)

This will build the hello-world project and deploy it to tomcat.
Hopefully you will see a "Blue Ball" next to the Entry under Build History,
if it's Red something went wrong.

Then you can see it by going to:
http://localhost:8080/hello-world


To see Jenkins do the auto-build & deploy you need to edit the file index.jsp
and commit the change to git:

vagrant ssh
cd /usr/local/src/hello-world/src/main/webapp/
pico index.jsp  - modify the Hello World part, save the file and exit pico
git add index.jsp
git commit -m 'updated index.jsp'

Then watch Jenkins build & autodeploy the new warfile to Tomcat, reload
http://localhost:8080 to see the change.

Note: Tomcat Manager is installed as well, if you want to play with it:
http://localhost:8080/manager , userid=manager, password=12345 for Tomcat Manager
